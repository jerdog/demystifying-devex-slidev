  ## Demystifying "DevEx", and why it matters 

  ## Abstract
  A key factor in shaping the productivity and innovation of software developers is what has come to be called “Developer Experience.” We'll begin with an introduction to DevEx, exploring its definition and significance in the tech world. We'll traverse the history of software development, highlighting how DevEx has evolved with technology. Key components, such as ergonomic tools, efficient workflows, and community support, are dissected to showcase their impact on a developer's day-to-day life. We'll look at successful and problematic DevEx scenarios, offering lessons and strategies for improvement. Then, we'll delve into practical tips for enhancing DevEx, discussing better practices and common pitfalls. Looking forward, we will explore emerging trends and future predictions, hopefully preparing us for the evolving landscape of software development. This talk is an essential journey through the world of DevEx, ideal for developers, team leaders, and tech enthusiasts keen on optimizing their development environments for better outcomes.

# A working definition of DevEx
  
>_"...the **journey** of developers and practitioners as they learn and deploy technology, which if successful, focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder them from achieving success in their endeavors."_

-**Jessica West**, _Co-Founder, DevEx Institute_

<!--
Let's start with a definition of DevEx - DevEx is the journey of developers as they learn and deploy technology. When successful, it focuses on eliminating obstacles that hinder a developer or practitioner from achieving success in their endeavors.

<!--
It's their overall satisfaction and efficiency while working on software projects. It's the tools, the processes, and the environments that shape their interactions with code, infrastructure, and each other. A positive DevEx is crucial for enhancing productivity as it directly influences how quickly and effectively developers can build, test, and deploy software.

<!--
DevEx is such an integral part of the entire development lifecycle - not just if you're developing tools for use internally, choosing off-the-shelf tools to use, or creating products for other developers and companies to use. That means that the ease of use, reliability, how accessible and understandable documentation, how efficient the build processes are, the effectiveness of testing frameworks, and the smoothness of deployment procedures all have an impact on the overall dev experience.

## DevEx isn't new

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012._

<!--
But DevEx isn't a new thing. The first mention of "developer experience" as a concept was in a paper was presented at the June IEEE 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process in Zurich. There are references in the paper going back to 1985 that deal with "programmer performance and the effects of the workplace." A few things stand out in this paper, which is a really great read.

## DevEx isn't new

>"New ways of working such as globally distributed development or the integration of self-motivated external developers into software ecosystems will require a better and more comprehensive understanding of developers' feelings, perceptions, motivations and identification with their tasks in their respective project environments."

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012._

## DevEx isn't new

>"...developer experience could be defined as a means for capturing how developers think and feel about their activities within their working environments, with the assumption that an improvement of the developer experience has positive impacts on characteristics such as sustained team and project performance."

_REF: F. Fagerholm and J. Münch, "[Developer experience: Concept and definition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6225984?arnumber=6225984)," 2012 International Conference on Software and System Process (ICSSP), Zurich, Switzerland, 2012._

<!--
The second was this line, that DevEx could be a means for capturing how devs think and feel about their activities at work, and that improving their experience impacts things like sustained team and project performance.

So all of this interest in DevEx isn't a new concept - but is largely driven by companies trying to sell you something, from the top down, with very little (if any) focus on developers themselves. We've all been there - we've been told we need to adopt a new way of working, and then had some new tool from some friend on the C-Suite who says that by simply using it, we'll be happier, more productive, and instantly a 10x engineer. Meanwhile, you've used it before and it's shit.
